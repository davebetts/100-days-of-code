It's time to take up the challenge!  The quest is to convert my regular creation and use of code into a potential coding powerhouse.  Throughout the next 100 days, I hope to begin building the bridge between being capable and true expertise, and perhapse a little eloquence.

The image above lists some of the resources and languages that have led me to this point.  Yes, this challenge is a beginning.  I will use the next 100 days to establish a foundation of knowledge and habits that will enahance my own work, and expand what I am able to offer to others.

<h4 align="center">
Initial Goals and Expectations
</h4>
I will work on two primary projects during my 100 Days of Code:
1. freecodecamp's Front End Development Certification
2. Cataloging and revising previous scripts (.R, .py) from my own research

Other existing coding projects may be included depending on what progress I can make over the next 100 days.

**Today’s Progress**: For day one I decided to see how far I could get through freecodecamp's Front End Development Certification in one hour.  I went from 101 lessons completed, to 117 lessons completed.  While this might not sound like much, I finished he JQuery section and **began the first real project:** Build a Tribute Page.

The last half-hour of my work was outlining what I wanted to do for my tribute page and 
**Thoughts:** Write additional thoughts here.
