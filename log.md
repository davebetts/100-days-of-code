It's time to take up the challenge!  The quest is to convert my current coding skills into a potential coding powerhouse.  Throughout the next 100 days, I hope to begin building the bridge between being capable and true expertise, and perhapse a little eloquence.


Several resources and languages (most of which are referenced in the image above) have led me to this point.  This is a change for a new beginning.  I will use the next 100 days to establish a foundation of knowledge and habits that will enahance my own work, and expand what I am able to offer to others.

<h4 align="center">Initial Goals and Expectations</h4>
I will work on two primary projects during my 100 Days of Code:

1. freecodecamp's Front End Development Certification
2. Cataloging and revising previous scripts (.R, .py) from my own research


Other existing coding projects may be included depending on what progress I can make over the next 100 days.

Day 1: 2018 January 05
</h2>

**Today’s Progress**: 16 lessons in frecodecamp's Front End Development Certification (102-117) **AND** I began the first real project: Build a Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** Today I wanted to see how far I could get through freecodecamp in an hour, adding to the work I've already started.  I was intent on having something to show for Day 1.  I ended up at the Build a Tribute Page project at the half hour, which was the perfect combination.  I practiced some new skills, and was given a chance to begin putting something of my own together.

Once I decided on my subject for the tribute, the outline and beginnings of my code came quickly.  The page isn't pretty (yet) so I'll save the actual code for later, but here's a peak at my upcoming tribute to the dwarf planet Pluto.

Day 2: 2018 January 6
</h2>
	
**Today’s Progress**: Trying to transform my outline of a tribute page into a well-designed web-page.  I also spent some of my time revising the mark-up language that I'm using to document my work within the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I was only able to add links to external web-pages today.  The rest of my time working on my Tribute Page was spent looking through my solutions to previous lessons to find the ways through which I can create the design I've imagined in my head. Today did not feel as productive as Day 1, but that's why I'm doing the challenge.  Learning to create what I can imagine takes time, and experimentation.
