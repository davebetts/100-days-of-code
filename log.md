It's time to take up the challenge!  The quest is to convert my regular creation and use of code into a potential coding powerhouse.  Throughout the next 100 days, I hope to begin building the bridge between being capable and true expertise, and perhapse a little eloquence.  
The image above lists some of the resources and languages that have led me to this point.  Yes, this challenge is a beginning.  I will use the next 100 days to establish a foundation of knowledge and habits that will enahance my own work, and expand what I am able to offer to others.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
